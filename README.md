## First Impressions of the Unity Interface
Opening the Unity Editor for the first time felt surprisingly welcoming. The interface looks modern, clean, and not as intimidating as I expected. Each panel has a clear purpose, and the layout makes it easy to understand where things belong. The Scene View immediately gives a sense of creative space, while the Hierarchy and Project panels keep everything neatly organized.

As I clicked around, I realized how smoothly the editor reacts and how accessible the tools feel. The Inspector shows every detail of a selected object without overwhelming me, and the Console makes it easy to notice errors or messages. Overall, the interface feels professional yet friendly, and it gives me confidence that I can learn and build projects step by step.
